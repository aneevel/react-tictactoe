# React - Tic Tac Toe Project

A quick project to get myself familiarized with React concepts and get some practical experience.

This is a small project that provides a small 3x3 grid to play Tic Tac Toe on. The sequence of moves
is also stored as part of the state, so that we may revert to previous states in the game's history.
